v0.2 (Work in Progress)
=======================

Currently under development.

Goals
-----
- Clean up hyperoptimization function
- Flesh out test suite
- Add more proximal operators

API Changes
-----------
- Updated display options to use the ``tableprint`` module, added more display options / levels of detail
- Renamed the ``num_iter`` parameter in ``Optimizer.minimize()`` to ``max_iter`` (more appropriate given that the algorithm
can stop early if tolerance is reached).
- Removed the function ``add_custom_regularizer``, its functionality is now handled by ``add_regularizer`` which takes
either a string input (as before) or a function as input (which it handles according to how ``add_custom_regularizer`` used to do).
