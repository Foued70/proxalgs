v0.1 (February 17, 2015)
========================

Initial release! Woo!

Sketched out the ``Optimizer`` class in ``core.py``, and added a number of useful proximal operators in ``operators.py``.

API Overview
------------
- The main functions of the ``Optimizer`` class are ``add_regularizer`` and ``minimize``
- The functions in ``operator`` can mostly be used by passing function names as strings to ``Optimizer.add_regularizer``
- Rudimentary support for hyperparameter optimization is provided by the ``Optimizer.hyperopt`` function

Known Issues
------------
- Documentation needs to be fleshed out
- The support for tensor operations is not very clean. Still thinking about the best way to do this
- Tests have been written for two toy cases, low-rank matrix approximation and sparse regression
